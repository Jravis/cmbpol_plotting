# Tools for plotting CMB polarization power spectra.

This repository contains IDL routines and data files for plotting observed B-mode power from CMB experiments with significant detections, and upper limits for B-mode power from other CMB experiments. Theoretical BB power spectra for a LCDM model are also plotted. The plots that are produced are similar to those on the LAMBDA graphics page, http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/graphics/. Comments in the IDL routines give further information. The IDL routines call readcol.pro and associated routines from the IDL Astronomy User's Library, http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The routines and data files will be updated as new results become available.
